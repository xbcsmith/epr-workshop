# Introduction to MCP Servers

An **MCP server** (Model Context Protocol server) acts as a bridge between AI models and external tools, data sources, or APIs. By exposing external resources as standardized "tools," MCP servers enable AI systems to access real-time data, perform actions, and extend their capabilities beyond static knowledge.

The main thing to understand: MCP Servers are basically just a standardized API for accessing your internal tools or data.

## Why Use MCP Servers?

- **Standardized Access:** MCP servers provide a unified interface for AI models to interact with diverse resources (APIs, databases, files, etc.).
- **Enhanced AI Capabilities:** They empower AI to fetch live data, trigger actions, and integrate with new tools easily.
- **Security & Compliance:** MCP servers can enforce access controls and privacy safeguards.
- **Scalability:** Easily add new data sources or tools without custom integrations.

## Key Components

- **MCP Host:** The application (e.g., IDE, AI assistant) that wants to access external resources.
- **MCP Client:** The AI model or component that interacts with the MCP server.
- **MCP Server:** The service that exposes tools and resources to the client.

## MCP Concepts

- **Tools:**  
  Tools are standardized operations or actions exposed by the MCP server. Each tool represents a specific capability, such as fetching data, searching, or creating a new record. Tools are described with metadata (name, description, parameters) so AI models can understand and use them.

- **Resources:**  
  Resources are the external systems, APIs, databases, or data objects that the MCP server provides access to via tools. For example, an event database, a file system, or a web API can be resources.

- **Prompts:**  
  Prompts are structured requests or instructions sent from the AI model (client) to the MCP server, specifying which tool to use and what parameters to provide. The server interprets the prompt, executes the tool, and returns the result.

**Analogy:**  
Think of an MCP server as a universal adapter for AIâ€”allowing models to connect to and use a wide variety of external resources with minimal effort.
