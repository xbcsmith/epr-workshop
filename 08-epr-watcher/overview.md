# EPR Watchers: Monitoring and Responding to Events

## Overview

Within the Event-Driven CI/CD architecture, EPR Watchers play a crucial role in
orchestrating downstream workflows. These microservice applications act as
dedicated consumers of events published to the Redpanda topic. Utilizing the
matching logic provided by the EPR SDK, they selectively process events based on
criteria like project identifier, event type (e.g., test result), and even
success/failure status.

## Key functionalities of EPR Watchers

### Targeted event processing

Watchers leverage the SDK's matching logic to ensure they only process relevant
events, optimizing efficiency and reducing noise.

### Automating downstream workflows

Watchers can trigger various actions upon receiving matching events, automating
tasks traditionally requiring manual intervention.

This could involve:

#### Webhook notification

Firing webhooks to alert other systems, such as triggering Jenkins jobs for
further processing.

#### Issue tracking integration

Creating tickets in ticketing systems like Jira, streamlining issue reporting
and management.

#### Custom actions

Performing any user-defined action based on specific event criteria, allowing
for tailored integration with various tools and processes.

## Benefits of using EPR Watcher

### Improved responsiveness

By automating downstream workflows, Watchers enable quicker reaction to events,
leading to faster build, test, and deployment cycles.

### Enhanced flexibility

The ability to create custom Watchers with tailored matching logic and actions
provides high flexibility in integrating with diverse tools and processes.

### Increased efficiency

By focusing on relevant events and automating tasks, Watchers free up
development teams to dedicate their expertise to more strategic work.

## Conlcusion

In essence, EPR Watchers act as the intelligent assistants within your
Event-Driven CI/CD pipeline, ensuring events are routed to the appropriate
downstream actions, leading to a more efficient and responsive development
process.
