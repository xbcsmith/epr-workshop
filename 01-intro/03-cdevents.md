# CDEvents: The Universal Language of CI/CD Pipelines

![CDEvents](../images/cdevents_horizontal-color-640.png)

CDEvents has emerged as the definitive specification for Continuous Delivery
event interoperability, providing a standardized vocabulary that spans the
entire software delivery lifecycle. As a CNCF incubating project, CDEvents v0.5+
has achieved significant adoption across major CI/CD platforms, enabling
unprecedented visibility and coordination across complex delivery pipelines.

Built upon CloudEvents as its foundation, CDEvents defines domain-specific event
types, data schemas, and semantic relationships that capture the nuanced
activities within modern software delivery processesâ€”from source code changes
through production deployment and operational feedback loops.

## The CDEvents Revolution in Modern CI/CD

### Platform-Agnostic Pipeline Observability

CDEvents has solved the long-standing problem of CI/CD pipeline visibility
across heterogeneous toolchains. Organizations can now aggregate events from
Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Tekton, and Argo Workflows into unified
dashboards that provide end-to-end delivery metrics regardless of underlying
implementation.

### Supply Chain Security Integration

In today's security-conscious environment, CDEvents serves as the backbone for
Software Supply Chain Security frameworks:

- **SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)** compliance tracking
  through standardized build and provenance events
- **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** generation events that trigger
  vulnerability assessments
- **Sigstore integration** events that capture artifact signing and verification
  activities
- **Policy violation events** that halt deployments when security thresholds are
  breached

### Regulatory Compliance and Auditability

CDEvents provides the immutable audit trail required for regulatory compliance
in highly regulated industries:

- **SOX compliance** through complete change tracking from code to production
- **PCI DSS requirements** via deployment events that capture security control
  validations
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 11** support through validated software delivery event
  chains
- **ISO 27001** evidence collection via comprehensive security event logging

## Advanced CDEvents Architecture Patterns

### Event Sourcing for Delivery Analytics

Modern organizations leverage CDEvents for sophisticated delivery analytics:

- **DORA metrics calculation** from standardized deployment frequency and lead
  time events
- **Value Stream Mapping** through event correlation across organizational
  boundaries
- **Bottleneck identification** via statistical analysis of event timing
  patterns
- **Predictive delivery forecasting** using machine learning on historical event
  streams

### Multi-Cloud Delivery Orchestration

CDEvents enables seamless coordination across cloud boundaries:

- **Cross-cloud deployments** where events from AWS CodePipeline trigger Azure
  DevOps releases
- **Hybrid pipeline coordination** between on-premises Jenkins and cloud-native
  Tekton
- **Edge deployment orchestration** with centralized control plane events
  managing distributed edge deployments
- **Disaster recovery automation** triggered by infrastructure failure events

### GitOps and Infrastructure as Code Integration

CDEvents provides the missing link in GitOps workflows:

- **Git events** trigger infrastructure provisioning through ArgoCD and Flux
- **Drift detection events** automatically remediate configuration
  inconsistencies
- **Policy violations** in infrastructure code generate compliance events
- **Resource lifecycle events** track infrastructure costs and environmental
  impact

## Domain-Specific Event Categories

### Core Delivery Events (v0.5+)

CDEvents defines comprehensive event categories that map to modern delivery
practices:

**Source Control Events**: Repository changes, branch protection updates, and
code review completions that initiate delivery workflows.

**Build and Package Events**: Compilation results, container image creation, and
artifact publication events with rich metadata about dependencies and
vulnerabilities.

**Test Execution Events**: Unit test results, integration test outcomes,
performance benchmarks, and security scan completions with detailed findings.

**Deployment Events**: Environment provisioning, application deployments,
rollback executions, and infrastructure updates with environment-specific
context.

**Service Events**: Service startup, health check results, performance metrics,
and incident declarations that provide operational feedback to delivery teams.

### Extended Event Categories (Modern Evolution)

**AI/ML Pipeline Events**: Model training completions, inference deployment
events, and model performance drift detection events.

**Infrastructure Events**: Resource provisioning, scaling events, cost threshold
breaches, and carbon footprint measurements.

**Security Events**: Vulnerability discoveries, penetration test results,
compliance validation completions, and threat detection alerts.

**Business Events**: Feature flag changes, A/B test results, user experience
metrics, and business KPI impacts from deployments.

## Enterprise Integration in Practice

### Message Broker Ecosystem

CDEvents in modern environments integrates seamlessly with current event
streaming platforms:

- **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput, durable event streaming with
  exactly-once semantics
- **AWS EventBridge** for serverless event routing with built-in filtering and
  transformation
- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** for global event distribution with automatic scaling
- **Azure Service Bus** for enterprise messaging with advanced routing
  capabilities

### Legacy System Integration

Organizations successfully integrate CDEvents with existing systems through:
**API Gateway Patterns**: Legacy systems expose CDEvents through OpenAPI
specifications with automated event translation.

**Event Store Adapters**: Historical delivery data from legacy systems generates
CDEvents for unified analytics.

**Message Transformation**: Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) solutions translate
between proprietary formats and CDEvents schemas.

**Webhook Adapters**: Legacy tools emit CDEvents through standardized webhook
transformations.

## Advanced Operational Patterns

### Event Correlation and Tracing

Modern CDEvents implementations provide sophisticated correlation capabilities:

- **Distributed tracing integration** with OpenTelemetry for end-to-end request
  tracking
- **Business transaction correlation** linking delivery events to customer
  impact
- **Cross-team collaboration** through shared event correlation identifiers
- **Incident root cause analysis** via event timeline reconstruction

### Event Replay and Time Travel Debugging

Production CDEvents systems enable powerful debugging capabilities:

- **Event replay** for testing pipeline changes against historical event streams
- **Point-in-time recovery** by replaying events up to specific deployment
  states
- **A/B testing** delivery process changes through parallel event stream
  processing
- **Chaos engineering** by injecting synthetic failure events into delivery
  pipelines

### Schema Evolution and Backward Compatibility

Enterprise CDEvents deployments handle schema evolution through:

- **Schema registry integration** with Confluent Schema Registry or AWS Glue
  Schema Registry
- **Backward compatibility validation** ensuring new event schemas don't break
  existing consumers
- **Progressive rollout** of schema changes with compatibility testing
- **Event versioning strategies** that support multiple schema versions
  simultaneously
