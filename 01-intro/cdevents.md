# Overview of CDEvents: Enhancing Cloud Events for Continuous Delivery

CDEvents extends the principles of Cloud Events to encompass Continuous Delivery (CD) processes, providing a specialized language for describing activities within this domain. This specification builds upon the well-established Enterprise Integration Patterns, as outlined in the book "Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions" by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf.

## Key Components and Concepts:

### Enterprise Integration Patterns Foundation:

CDEvents is grounded in the principles of Enterprise Integration Patterns, providing a solid foundation for designing and deploying messaging solutions.

### Event Message Design Pattern:

CDEvents leverages the Event Message design pattern to broadcast information related to activities within a Continuous Delivery process. This information is represented in a Normalized Form, ensuring consistency and clarity.

### Broadcasting with Normalized Form:

Events in CDEvents are broadcasted, allowing information about Continuous Delivery activities to be shared across the environment. The use of a normalized form ensures a common understanding of the events, fostering consistency in interpretation.

### Propagation through Message Brokers or Message Buses:

CDEvents supports the propagation of events through Message Brokers or Message Buses. This enables the seamless dissemination of Continuous Delivery-related information across different components of the system.

### Publish-Subscribe Pattern:

Following the Publish-Subscribe pattern, components within the delivery process can express interest in specific types of CDEvents. This allows for targeted notification and response to relevant activities.

### System Agnosticism and Semantic Information:

CDEvents promotes a system-agnostic approach, where any system speaking the normalized CDEvents vocabulary can respond to events from any other system without prior knowledge about the originating system. This facilitates interoperability and flexibility.

### Integration Simplicity:

Integrating CDEvents with other systems, such as messaging systems, provides a simple and efficient mechanism for exchanging and processing events. Interoperability and integration using CDEvents is straightforward when the target technology already understands the CDEvents vocabulary. In such cases, any messaging system capable of handling Event Messages can be used for event propagation. For legacy systems that do not comprehend CDEvents natively, Channel Adapters and Message Translators can be implemented to bridge the gap, allowing these systems to share and consume CDEvents without internal understanding.

## Conclusion: 

CDEvents provides a specialized and standardized language for communicating and sharing information within Continuous Delivery processes. By extending the principles of Cloud Events and embracing well-established integration patterns, CDEvents ensures a coherent and interoperable approach to handling events, enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of systems involved in Continuous Delivery.
