## Intro to CloudEvents and EPR

## Overview

In this section we will cover the CloudEvents and EPR concepts and how to use them.

Introduction — CloudEvents Workshop Session

Welcome — in this workshop you'll get hands-on experience using CloudEvents with the Event Provenance Registry (EPR). CloudEvents is an open, vendor-neutral specification for describing event metadata and payloads so producers and consumers can interoperate across platforms, protocols, and runtimes. The specification focuses on a small, stable set of context attributes (for example `id`, `source`, `type`, `specversion`, `time`, `datacontenttype`, and `data`) and provides a layered model (base spec, extensions, format encodings, and protocol bindings) so the same event description can be expressed over HTTP, AMQP, Kafka, and other transports.

In this session I’ll guide you through the practical steps of:
- authoring CloudEvents that represent occurrences in an event-driven system,
- storing those CloudEvents in the EPR to preserve provenance and enable auditing, and
- retrieving and querying events from EPR to analyze event history and behavior.

Why this matters
- Interoperability: CloudEvents standardizes the minimal metadata needed for routing and processing so consumers don’t need custom parsing logic for each platform.
- Decoupling: Producers and consumers can be developed and released independently; events describe facts, not destinations.
- Portability & tooling: A common format makes it easier to share examples, mock events, and build reusable tooling (for testing, tracing, and replay).
- Provenance & auditing: Persisting well-structured CloudEvents in EPR gives you an auditable trail while preserving the event semantics that other systems expect.

What we’ll cover (high level)
- CloudEvents fundamentals — core attributes, extension attributes, and the rationale behind a minimal event context.
- Creating CloudEvents — authoring structured and binary-mode events and when to use each.
- Versioning considerations — using `type` and `dataschema` to evolve event formats safely.
- Protocol and encoding bindings — how the same CloudEvent maps to protocols such as HTTP and Kafka.
- EPR integration — best practices for storing events for provenance, querying by attributes, and grouping events into receivers for organized handling.
- Practical exercises — you’ll produce example CloudEvents, push them into EPR, and run queries to demonstrate real-world workflows.

Audience & prerequisites
- Developers and architects who design or consume event-driven systems.
- Basic familiarity with JSON and HTTP is useful; no deep prior knowledge of CloudEvents is required — the workshop provides the essential context and hands-on steps.

Expected outcomes
By the end of the workshop you will be able to:
- Create CloudEvents with appropriate core attributes and extensions for your use cases.
- Map CloudEvents to common transport protocols in either structured or binary mode.
- Persist CloudEvents into EPR and query them to retrieve provenance and audit information.
- Reason about event versioning and when to change `type` versus `dataschema`.
- Organize event receivers and design simple event grouping strategies for operational workflows.
