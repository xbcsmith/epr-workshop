## Workshop Format

### Hands-On Learning Approach
The session emphasizes practical implementation over theoretical discussion. Each participant will complete every setup step on their own machine, ensuring they leave with a fully functional development environment.

### Interactive Demonstrations
Instructors will demonstrate each installation and configuration step, followed by guided practice sessions where participants implement the same configurations. Real-time troubleshooting and Q&A sessions address common issues immediately.

### Platform-Specific Guidance
The workshop provides detailed instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux environments, ensuring all participants can successfully complete the setup regardless of their chosen development platform.

### Verification and Testing
Each setup phase includes verification steps to confirm proper installation and configuration. Participants will run test commands and simple applications to validate their environment before proceeding to the next component.

## Key Learning Objectives

### Technical Proficiency
- **Container Orchestration**: Understand Docker and Docker Compose for managing complex multi-service applications
- **Go Development**: Configure a professional Go development environment with proper tooling and best practices  
- **Event Streaming**: Set up and configure Kafka-compatible message brokers for event-driven architectures
- **Database Management**: Deploy and configure PostgreSQL for event storage and querying capabilities
- **Development Workflow**: Establish efficient development practices for distributed systems

### Architectural Understanding  
- **Microservice Dependencies**: Understand how event-driven services depend on messaging and storage infrastructure
- **Configuration Management**: Learn proper techniques for managing configuration across development and production environments
- **Service Discovery**: Configure service networking and communication patterns for local development
- **Observability Setup**: Implement logging, monitoring, and debugging capabilities for distributed systems

### Best Practices Integration
- **Security Configuration**: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms from the start
- **Code Quality**: Set up automated code quality checks and formatting tools
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Configure unit, integration, and end-to-end testing capabilities
- **Documentation Standards**: Establish documentation practices for complex distributed systems
