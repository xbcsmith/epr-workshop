# Workshop Session: Advanced EPR - Creating, Storing, and Tracking SBOMs

1. Create a CycloneDX SBOM with Open Source Tools:

    Initiate the workshop by guiding participants through the creation of a CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using open-source tools.
    Explore the CycloneDX standard, emphasizing the importance of SBOMs in software supply chain security.

2. Use EPR Events to Store SBOMs:

    Demonstrate how to leverage EPR Events for the seamless storage of SBOMs. Discuss the structure and format of SBOMs within the EPR storage system.
    Emphasize the benefits of utilizing EPR as a centralized repository for SBOMs, enabling efficient tracking and management.

3. Use CDEvents to Record SBOM Creation:

    Introduce the use of Continuous Delivery Events (CDEvents) to record the creation of SBOMs. Discuss the specific attributes and metadata relevant to SBOM events.
    Illustrate how CDEvents contribute to a comprehensive record of the SBOM creation process, enhancing transparency and traceability.

4. Retrieving SBOMs from EPR:

    Guide participants in retrieving SBOMs from the EPR storage, demonstrating various querying techniques and filters.
    Discuss the significance of easy access to SBOMs for auditing, compliance, and security purposes.

Workshop Format:

    The session will involve a mix of presentations, live demonstrations, and hands-on exercises.
    Participants will actively engage in creating CycloneDX SBOMs, storing them in EPR Events, and utilizing CDEvents to record the SBOM creation process.
    Practical scenarios and use cases will be explored to showcase real-world applications of advanced EPR features.

Key Learning Objectives:

    Gain practical experience in creating CycloneDX SBOMs using open-source tools.
    Understand how to use EPR Events for storing and managing SBOMs effectively.
    Explore the role of CDEvents in recording SBOM creation events for enhanced traceability.
    Acquire skills in retrieving SBOMs from the EPR storage system.

Note: This advanced workshop session is designed to elevate participants' proficiency in utilizing EPR for sophisticated tasks such as creating, storing, and tracking Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). Participants will leave with practical skills applicable to securing the software supply chain and enhancing overall software transparency.
