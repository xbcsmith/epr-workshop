# Intro to SBOMs

In this section of the workshop, we will introduce the SBOMs.

## What are SBOMs?

SBOMs are short for Software Bill of Materials. They are a format for storing
and tracking software components, their dependencies, and their versions. They
are becoming a fundamental part of the software development lifecycle.

## Formats of SBOMs

SBOMs are stored in different formats.

The two most common formats are:

- SPDX
- CycloneDX

## SPDX

From the [SPDX](https://spdx.dev) website.

System Package Data Exchange (SPDXÂ®)

An open standard capable of representing systems with software components in as
SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) and other AI, data and security references
supporting a range of risk management use cases.

The SPDX specification is a freely available international open standard
(ISO/IEC 5692:2021).

## CycloneDX

From the [OWASP CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org) website.

OWASP CycloneDX is a full-stack Bill of Materials (BOM) standard that provides
advanced supply chain capabilities for cyber risk reduction.

The specification supports:

- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- Software-as-a-Service Bill of Materials (SaaSBOM)
- Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOM)
- Machine Learning Bill of Materials (ML-BOM)
- Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM)
- Manufacturing Bill of Materials (MBOM)
- Operations Bill of Materials (OBOM)
- Vulnerability Disclosure Reports (VDR)
- Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)
- CycloneDX Attestations (CDXA)
