# Workshop Session: Python EPR - Working with the Python Client

1. Hands-On Session on Using the EPR Python Client:

    Kick off the workshop with a hands-on session, providing participants with practical experience in using the Event Provenance Registry (EPR) Python client.
    Guide participants through the installation of the Python client and ensure that everyone has the necessary dependencies set up.

2. Creating Event Receivers using the EPR Python Client:

    Dive into the creation of Event Receivers using the EPR Python client. Walk participants through the process of defining receiver attributes, such as name, version, description, type, and schema.
    Emphasize the importance of well-defined receivers in capturing specific types of events.

3. Creating Event Receiver Groups using the EPR Python Client:

    Extend the hands-on experience by guiding participants through the creation of Event Receiver Groups using the Python client.
    Demonstrate how to associate Event Receivers with groups, highlighting the benefits of organized event handling.

4. Creating Events using the EPR Python Client:

    Shift focus to creating events using the EPR Python client. Explore the attributes and metadata associated with events, including name, version, release, platform, package, success, description, and payload.
    Showcase the versatility of event creation, covering different use cases and scenarios.

5. Searching for Events using the EPR Python Client:

    Conclude the session by demonstrating how to search for events using the EPR Python client. Explore various search criteria, including event IDs, fields, and filters.
    Discuss effective strategies for querying and retrieving specific sets of events based on different requirements.

Workshop Format:

    The workshop will combine live demonstrations with hands-on exercises using the EPR Python client.
    Participants will actively create Event Receivers, Event Receiver Groups, and Events, gaining practical experience with each step.
    Q&A sessions will be incorporated to address participant queries and provide additional insights.

Key Learning Objectives:

    Gain hands-on experience in using the EPR Python client for interacting with the EPR system.
    Learn how to create Event Receivers and Event Receiver Groups programmatically.
    Acquire skills in creating events with specific attributes using the Python client.
    Understand effective strategies for searching and retrieving events using the Python client.

Note: This workshop session is designed to empower participants with practical skills in working with the EPR Python client. By actively creating and managing Event Receivers, Event Receiver Groups, and Events, participants will develop a comprehensive understanding of using Python to interact with the Event Provenance Registry.
